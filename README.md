## Inversion of Control Software Pattern

### from Kent C. Dodds

This is a place to play with Kent's very cool software pattern that
gives client's of your React components tremendous power and flexibility to extend your
work visually and behaviorally while keeping the code relatively compact
and maintainable.

The work comes from his 'Simply React' keynotes in which he walks through the evolution of an Accordion component with class-based (2018) and hooks-based (2020)
implementations.

Behavior is extended through a diy state reducer that augments the bundled accordion reducer.
