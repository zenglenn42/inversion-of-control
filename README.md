## Inversion of Control Software Pattern

### _Fighting prop-bloat and maintenance blues in your React components_

Imagine you've written a new React component with a set of props to support a reasonable collection of use-cases. You want to share your work with others, so you publish and blog a bit.

If the gods of SEO and open source smile, you're rewarded with the blessing (and maybe curse?) of widespread interest and adoption.

The curse comes in the form of requests and (hopefully) PRs for extensions and use-cases you hadn't anticpated. Initially, you bask in the glow of acknowledged value ...

... but you eventually notice your crisp code descending into a maintenance muddle. The prop count grows. You struggle to add test cases to handle the combinatorial complexity implied by so many options. It's hard keeping up with the demand for modifications while still maintaining quality and coherence to your original concept.

Has your gift to the world become an [albatross](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/albatross_around_one%27s_neck) around your neck?

### Solution: Bring Your Own Behavior Reducer

---

Sometimes the answer may be to pass control _back_ to the flock of eager adoptees with an implementation that _encourages_ extension without having to rewrite the underlying component at each turn.

I've recently become a fan of [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com) after watching his two **'Simply React'** keynotes in [2018](https://youtu.be/AiJ8tRRH0f8) and [2020](https://youtu.be/5io81WLgXtg) where he discusses 'inversion of control' in the context of a highly extensible Accordion component.

The key points are:

- expose layout logic for easy modification by clients
- support extensible component behavior through chainable, developer-supplied state reducers

Importantly, you still craft reasonable defaults for layout and behavior to meet your needs (and hopefully those of many others). However, if you allow one or more DIY behavior reducers to be passed in, then you may side-step the need to anticipate or laboriously support variant policies such as:

- only allow 1 visible item at a time
- require that at least 1 item be visible at all times
- allow multiple visible items

You _invert_ control by enabling the component consumer to extend behavior in their scope rather than wedging their novel use-case into your code.

### 2. Nested Accordion

To illustrate Kent's point about extensibility, I implement my own _nested_ Accordion variant.

In the process, I sketch out an Accordion that supports two more types of reducers beyond his behavior reducer:

- input data reducers

  - For a nested Accordion, the input data may include nested items.
  - However, rendering is currently a map across a 1-dimensional array of items.
  - Can we craft a _data reducer_ to linearize that input so renders still work?

- layout reducers
  - How might we decouple layout from being tied to a given component library such as Emotion or Material-UI?
  - Can we address the unique requirements of a nested Accordion if we pass in our own layout reducer?

I'm still playing, but initial attempts at answering these questions look promising.

#### Here are the recursively defined input data:

App.js

```javascript
const nestedItems = [
  {
    title: 'üê¥',
    contents: (
      <div>
        Horses can sleep both lying ...
      </div>
    )
  },
  {
    title: '‚ãØ',
    items: [
      {
        title: 'üêò',
        contents: (
          <div>
            Elephants are mammals of the ...
          </div>
        )
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ...
]

function App() {
  <Accordion items={items} />
}
```

Accordion.js

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { useAccordion } from './useAccordion'

function Accordion(props) {
  const { items, ...optional } = props
  const { components } = useAccordion({ items, ...optional })
  return <div>{components}</div>
}

export { Accordion }
```

useAccordion.js

```javascript
...

// Support indented layouts ...

function verticalBelowLayoutReducer(components, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case layoutActionTypes.map_items:
      return action.items.map((item, index) => {
        if (isVisible(item, action.items, action.expandedItems)) {

          action.type
      )

}

// Flatten nested input json into a single dimension
// array, augmented with knowledge of parent index

  const flattenedItems = nestedItems.reduce((acc, item, index) => {
    const hasNestedItems = item.items

    } else {

        ...item,
        depth: depth,
        parent: parent

    return acc

  return flattenedItems
